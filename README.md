# Casting App

This is a application geared towards the theatre, film/TV casting world. It looks to help casting directors organize auditions and go paperless. The actors coming in to audtion will receive a link to register so that their info can be in the database, instead of filling out a sheet of paper at the auditions.  The casting directors can create projects, the roles for those projects and schedule the auditions for the those roles.

## What would I like to expand on?
* I want to build a module that handles the check in process at the audition.  Actors would click on their name, verify their info, and check-in.
* The ability for casting directors to send emails through the app.
* Casting should be able to add notes to each actor on their audition.
* Being able to compare actor profiles side by side during the decision process.
